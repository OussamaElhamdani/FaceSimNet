# FaceSimNet
> "Morpheus: Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."

## Overview on the project workflow 
FaceSimNet is the name i give to this model whose predicting the similarity degree between two input faces. At first glance it's a challenging project since just the way to similarity and then the data labels of these are not really straightforward. The really one key that helped me model these is the simplification of the project into a face verification project.

## How you should read Notebooks
This project follows a structured workflow that is designed to help you understand the key components and implementation details. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Main Notebook**: Begin by reviewing the `main` notebook. This notebook contains theoretical details and serves as an overview or project review. It provides essential background information on the project.

2. **Imgprocessing Notebook**: After reviewing the `main` notebook, proceed to the `Imgprocessing` notebook. This notebook covers various image processing techniques used in the project. Understanding these techniques is crucial for grasping the subsequent model implementation.

3. **Model Notebook**: Finally, explore the `model` notebook. This notebook delves into the main ideas and implementation details of the project. By this point, you should have a solid understanding of the project's theoretical foundations and image processing techniques, which will aid in comprehending the model implementation.

By following this structured workflow, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the project from its theoretical underpinnings to its practical implementation.
